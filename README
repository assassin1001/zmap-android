ZMap is a fast network scanner designed for Internet-wide network surveys. On a
typical desktop computer with a gigabit Ethernet connection, ZMap is capable
scanning the entire public IPv4 address space in under five minutes.

While previous network tools have been designed to scan small network segments,
ZMap is specifically architected to scan the entire address space.  It is built
in a modular manner in order to allow incorporation with other network survey
tools.  ZMap operates on GNU/Linux and supports TCP SYN and ICMP echo request
scanning out of the box.

This fork of ZMap has been modified to compile for and run on Android
devices. Changes include:
 - getifaddrs implementation from https://github.com/kmackay/android-ifaddrs
 - BSD-style tcp.h definition of tcphdr struct

To use this fork, install the Android NDK, and follow the instructions from
http://www.kandroid.org/ndk/docs/STANDALONE-TOOLCHAIN.html to set up a
toolchain.  Make sure the toolchain is in your path and the CC environment
variable is set correctly.  Compile the dependencies:
 - libpcap, using `./configure --host=arm-linux-androideabi --with-pcap=linux`
 - libgmp, using `./configure --host=arm-linux-androideabi`
Install these dependencies to your toolchain sysroot using `make install
DESTDIR=$TOOLCHAIN/sysroot/`.  To build zmap you can now use cmake with the PATH
and CC variables set and it will invoke the toolchain.  It may be necessary to
copy library files from sysroot/local/lib to sysroot/lib for them to be located
by the compiler.  Finally, you will need to install these libraries on
your Android device or bring them along with zmap and set LD_LIBRARY_PATH
accordingly.

Known issues:
- ztee currently does not build due to the lack of get_line in android
- Support for optional zmap features such as redis integration has not been
investigated
- json support is not currently enabled
